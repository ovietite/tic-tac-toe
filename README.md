Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game written in Java, implementing Object-Oriented Design principles for code structure and organisation. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing library, enabling two players to take turns and make moves on the game board. The game checks for win or draw conditions after each turn, and features an AI opponent that selects random available cells on the board.
